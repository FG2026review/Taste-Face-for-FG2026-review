# Frame Images

This directory contains frame-level images extracted from the raw videos.

Structure:
frames/<subject_id>/<taste_type>/frame_XXXX.jpg

Each directory corresponds to one video in `data/videos/` and preserves temporal order.

Frames are provided as a standardized visual representation for direct use in image-based and sequence-based models.

In the current public release, this directory may contain only a subset of the full dataset.
