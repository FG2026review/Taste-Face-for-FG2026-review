# Subjective Rating Protocol

Subjective taste perception was collected using a standardized rating sheet.

Participants were asked to evaluate each taste stimulus on the following dimensions:

1. Identified Correctly  
   Whether the participant could clearly identify the taste category
   (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami, or astringent).

2. Perceived Intensity (0–10)  
   A numerical rating of the perceived intensity:
   - 0: No sensation, indistinguishable from plain solution.
   - 5: Clearly perceivable and acceptable.
   - 10: Clearly perceivable and highly intense, difficult to tolerate.

3. Aftertaste Intensity (0–10)  
   The strength of the residual taste after swallowing or removing the stimulus.

Participants could also provide a brief free-text description of their sensation.

All ratings were collected immediately after each stimulus presentation.
