# Taste-Face Dataset Overview

Taste-Face is a multimodal dataset designed to study the relationship between
basic taste stimuli and facial behavioral responses.

The dataset consists of three core components:

1. Raw facial videos recorded during controlled taste stimulation.
2. Frame-level image sequences derived from the raw videos.
3. Subjective ratings collected from participants after each stimulus.

Each trial corresponds to a controlled taste stimulus
(sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness, umami, or astringency) applied to a participant,
followed by:

- A recorded facial video sequence;
- A set of extracted frame images;
- A row in the subjective rating table.

The dataset is intended for research on:
- Taste-related facial behavior analysis;
- Cross-modal learning between perception and vision;
- Human-centered evaluation of perceptual difficulty.

All data were collected under informed consent and released for
non-commercial academic research only.
